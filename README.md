# Doom Emacs



Some years ago, I embarked on the noble quest to learn something about programming. While looking for a manual on the internet, I found the PDF "Computational Physics: A Practical Introduction to Computational Physics and Scientific Computing (using C++)". 
I never read the whole thing; in fact, true to my usual habit, I only skimmed the first chapter, and if I remember correctly, not even the entire thing, which, amusingly, wasn't about C++ at all but rather a text editor called Emacs—a strange tool that, for reasons I can't quite explain, I found incredibly enjoyable.
Thus began my peculiar hobby: meticulously adding snippets to my personal configuration—mostly through the high art of copying and pasting, wanting to change this or that, gaining in the process some enjoyment and quite a few headaches.

Fast forward to today, Sunday, July 14, 2024. I hereby surrender. 
Despite a deep sense of nostalgia that binds me to this arcane tool, I find no compelling reason to continue this masochistic ritual. 
With Doom Emacs, I hope to save some time; I hope the opposite doesn't happen.
