# Doom Emacs
Some years ago, I embarked on the noble quest to learn something about programming. While looking for a manual on the internet, I found the PDF "Computational Physics: A Practical Introduction to Computational Physics and Scientific Computing (using C++)". 
I never read the whole thing; in fact, as is common for me, I only read the first chapter, and if I remember correctly, not even the entire chapter, and that chapter wasn't even about C++, but about a text editor called Emacs, and I don't know exactly why, but I found that strange tool really enjoyable.
Thus began my peculiar hobby: meticulously adding snippets to my personal configurationâ€”mostly through the high art of copying and pasting.

Fast forward to today, Sunday, July 14, 2024. I hereby surrender. 
Despite a deep sense of nostalgia that binds me to this arcane tool, I find no compelling reason to continue this masochistic ritual. 
With Doom Emacs, I hope to save some time; I hope the opposite doesn't happen.
